OBJECTIVE:
My goal was to assist organizations in improving employee retention and performance by creating a comprehensive HR Analytics Dashboard.

STEPS FOLLOWED:
1. #DataExtraction: Extracted the client-provided data.
2. #DataTransformation: Loaded the data into Power BI, where I removed nulls and duplicates, corrected spelling errors, and adjusted data types using Power Query.
3. #DataLoading: The transformed data was loaded into Power View for further analysis.
4. #DataModelling: Created a logical data structure through the data modeling process, enabling effective analysis and visualization.
5. #DAXImplementation: Utilized Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to refine the data, creating calculated measures and columns for advanced analysis.
6. #Reports: Developed user-friendly reports and interactive visualizations through the dashboard.

KEY INSIGHTS:
✅ Employees aged 26 to 35 exhibit the highest attrition rate.
✅ Roles in Life Sciences Education and Laboratory Technician domains demonstrate the highest attrition percentages.
✅ Job satisfaction is directly related to attrition rates across various roles.
✅ Employees with 1 to 2 years of experience display the highest attrition rates. Surprisingly, employees earning below the average salary of 6.5k are more likely to leave the company.
